This page was last updated on 2024-12-14.

ZEM stands for Zone Experience Modifier. This is a zone-wide buff to experience that improves gains.

How this is calculated:
- The base ZEM of most zones is 2.0
- All ZEMs are subjected by 1.0, making average 1.0
- I multiply the ZEM by 100 to make it a percent, so all zones untouched are at 100%
- So a zone with 150% ZEM is 50% more experience than average
